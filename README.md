Introduction
The provided C++ code implements a simple Bank Account Management System. This system allows users to create and manage bank accounts, make deposits and withdrawals, transfer funds between accounts, and view account details. It's designed as a basic simulation of a real-world banking system.

Code Structure
BankAccount Class
The BankAccount class is the foundation for all types of bank accounts in the system. It encapsulates common attributes and methods.
IFSC (Indian Financial System Code): This is a code used to uniquely identify bank branches in India.
AccountNo (Account Number): A unique identifier for each account.
InterestRate: Represents the interest rate applicable to the account.
min_bal (Minimum Balance): Specifies the minimum balance required for the account.
bal (Current Balance): Stores the current balance of the account.
name: Holds the account holder's full name.
password: Stores the account password.
DOB (Date of Birth): Records the account holder's date of birth.
pan (PAN Card Number): Stands for Permanent Account Number, a unique identifier for taxpayers in India.
The constructor initializes IFSC and InterestRate with default values.
The setDetails method allows users to input their personal information, including name, date of birth, and PAN card number. It also generates a unique account number for each new account.
The deposit method increases the account balance when a user makes a deposit.
The withdraw method checks whether the account balance is sufficient to process a withdrawal and performs the withdrawal operation accordingly.
The displayDetails method displays various details of the account, including account number, name, date of birth, IFSC code, and current balance.
SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount Classes
These two derived classes, SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount, inherit from the BankAccount class. They specify the minimum balance requirement and interest rate for their respective account types.
Savings Account:
Requires a minimum balance of 1500 INR.
Earns interest at a rate of 4.5%.
Current Account:
Has no minimum balance requirement.
Does not earn any interest.
Main Function
The main function is the entry point of the program.
It provides a user-friendly menu-driven interface for users to interact with the banking system.
Users can choose to:
Create a new account by specifying a password and account type (savings or current).
Log in to an existing account by providing their account number and password.
Perform various banking operations such as withdrawing funds, depositing funds, making bank transfers, viewing account details, or exiting the program.
Passwords are rigorously validated during creation to ensure they contain at least one character, one number, and one special character.
Randomly generated account numbers are unique and help prevent conflicts among account holders.
Usage
Compile the C++ code using a suitable compiler (e.g., g++).
Execute the compiled program (the generated executable).
Follow the on-screen prompts and menu options to perform various banking operations, create accounts, or view account details.

It's essential to recognize that this code serves as a foundational example and lacks several advanced features and security measures that a real-world banking application would require. In a production-grade banking system, you must:

Implement robust error handling to handle edge cases.
Employ advanced security measures, including data encryption, secure communication, and secure authentication mechanisms.
Comply with financial regulations and industry standards, such as those set by banking authorities.
Conduct extensive testing, including security testing and stress testing, to ensure the system's reliability and security.
Continuously maintain and update the system to address emerging security threats and regulatory changes.
